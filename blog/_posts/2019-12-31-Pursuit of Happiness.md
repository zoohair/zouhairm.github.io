description: 'Rationalizing career and life choices: a non-linear path in the pursuit of happiness.'
---

At an end-of-year gathering, a friend reminded me that I said I'd share some of my experience during the sabbatical. Unfortunately while I intended to post one of these per month, I've been (mentally) stretched thin while trying to figure out life and career this last few months.

The post roughly covers the *Lessons learned from searching for a job (and turning down opportunities) in Singapore* - followed by the experience of what re-joining the labor force has been like. It is a long one so buckle up!

[**#coronaperspective** I drafted this post to share two months ago, but let's just say that plans have been disrupted... Considering that I'm again spending a lot of time thinking about career and life choices, and that we've been back in the Bay for exactly one year now, it seems appropriate to dust it up as I reflect on that struggle again given the new circumstances following the Covid-19 pandemic.]


# Uncertainty Angst

We celebrated the arrival of 2019 on our South African friends' boat.
Although somewhat adrift and unclear about what our next move was, I didn't mind the uncertainty too much. In fact, I thrived in it: the humidity induced sweat, the constant salty hair, the sun kissed skin, meeting new people every day, living at the rhythm of the tides - what's there not to love? Maybe let's ask Olivia - here is an excerpt of what she wrote during that period:
> I want out of this humidity that steams the meat right off my bones. I want to be able to take a walk when I need to clear my head, I want my alone time back, I want it so bad I could cry. I want to wear city clothes and drive my car. I want to take a proper shower in a proper bathroom. **I want to figure out my life**, preferably with decent Internet.

Faced with an uncomfortable and borderline miserable partner just barely 6 months after our wedding, an action plan was needed. Thus it was agreed that we would aim to settle in a new place with some reasonable job prospects by June 2019. With that goal in mind, we dusted up our matrix of potential destinations vs. Must-Haves and Nice-to-haves; an attempt at identifying where we might seek adventure next which was inspired by a report of the [best and worst places for expats.](https://www.internations.org/expat-insider/2016/the-best-and-worst-places-for-expats){:target="&#95;blank"}


# The Singapore Compromise

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}

Our criteria made it hard to find an all-out winner, and so we needed a compromise. Vancouver and New-Zealand scored the best; however, being Canadian, and having had the opportunity through work to travel frequently to NZ, I pushed us to try something 'different': Singapore. And just like that, we had a destination that we could now start planning around.

[**#coronaperspective** It's interesting to think about how some of these countries have handled the pandemic so far: not only in their success, but also their treatment of foreigners - will try to keep an eye out on attitude shifts towards immigration/expats and travel in general]

We still had some wanderings planned: a stopover in Oman, a visit to the newly minted nephews in London, and 2 months at a horse barn in Sri Lanka. Still with the destination set, the weight of the uncertainty was lifted; and immediately replaced with the stress of job hunting. When you already have a job, and are working in an area where engineers are sought after, jobs seem to fall on your lap: recruiters, in-mails, word-to-mouth. It's almost like you barely have to stretch your arm to pluck one. But here we were, 9 months out of the job market and in a new country without any contacts. Where do we even start? We still had 2 months to go, but we wanted to get a head start and searching online.

#### Virtual Job Search

At first, searching for jobs seemed like an easy task: enter a few keywords in LinkedIn, find an interesting position, upload a CV and voil√†! Unfortunately, for all the simplicity that LinkedIn brings, it has turned job searching into online dating: the companies sift through 100s of applicants (each of which boasting about their amazing accomplishments) and just like online dating they never get back to you. LinkedIn also comes with some of the caveats of most social-networks: everyone seems so happy and successful with their lives (careers), and there you are wondering whether your life decisions have failed you. Suffice to say that after four weeks my self-esteem was at rock bottom.
Olivia didn't fare better, and in some respect things were even harder for her. While there were a few technical job openings that could be a good fit for me, there were far fewer interesting marketing jobs for someone with her background, and most required regional experience or product-specific knowledge.

After a month and 60+ submissions, only a couple had gotten back to us. We clearly needed a different strategy for this to work. In hindsight, these were the 2 most important lessons during this time:
* Starting the search soon made sense, but it was not worth wasting valuable time during the trip for it
* People in Singapore value in-person relationships; we needed to be there to stand a chance


#### In Situ Job Search

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}

Singapore is humid and hot, but compared to the last 6 months, it was paradise: air conditioned everything, delicious and varied food, clean, and ubiquitous (I miss that word) public transportation.

We email blasted our friends and ex-coworkers back in California and asked for introductions, and we began our in-person networking phase. I often had 4 meetings a day, with at least one leading up to another connection or meeting. It felt like we were finally getting some traction.

Alas, it was proving hard to turn these meetings into proper interviews let alone offers. A friend would later explain to me that I needed to adjust my expectations regarding timelines: his last job hunting stint took him 5 months from first meeting to offer; definitely not the pace we were used to. Still, there were a few leads that were exciting: a position with large consulting firm focused on future of mobility research, another in an autonomous driving startup, one helping open a new office for a large engineering consulting firm, and the last as an entrepreneur-in-residence with a VC firm.

#### The 2-body Problem
I had pushed hard for Singapore, and I really wanted it to work out. But the gap between what we had hoped for and the reality we were facing was slowly taking its toll.

We were starting to realize that getting work Visas was not going to be a slam dunk. We did our research beforehand and based on the different blogs and government websites, we expected that with our education and experience it should be straightforward. It turns out that in practice most companies have to deal with quotas, and despite having applied for an independent visa (i.e. we wouldn't require sponsorship), we were told that it still counted against their quotas and therefore they were more hesitant about considering us for jobs.

Salaries were another factor we were quickly finding out was going to be an issue. On the one hand, living in Singapore can be cheap (eating at hawkers markets, no need for a car); on the other hand, enjoying life in Singapore is expensive (eating at nice restaurants, renting in nice neighborhoods, traveling to neighboring countries, and pretty much everything else). Most expats are on relocation packages and so this is a non-issue. For us, especially when comparing to our earning potential back in the US, it was becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the money we would be leaving on the table.

#### Utility Function for Life Choices

<div>
Olivia was still not finding anything as interesting, and to complicate things, she was being contacted by recruiters back in California with some very exciting positions. She was also starting to have strong doubts about settling somewhere where hose riding wasn't as accessible while being so far from the community we built back in there. After a couple of weeks in Singapore, she flew back to the US for an interview. As luck would have it, that interview didn't go so well, but there was so much opportunity that before she flew back she had another interview which was promising. By the time she flew back to Singapore, she was in the final stages of the process, and before we knew it she had an offer. Talk about a different pace... Although I was keen to make this work and I was willing to make sacrifices, the hardest sacrifice wasn't going to be mine but Olivia's: she had an offer for a role similar to the one she left, with a team that sounded awesome, in an area that she loves, close to friends and, well, horses. We sketched our respective distributions of utility functions, and despite the promise of adventure abroad, the stars didn't seem to line up. And so after almost a year of wandering, we decided to head back to the Bay Area for our next chapter.<br><br><br><br>

# Home Sweet Home - aka Whiplash

{: refdef}

We left for 12 months, traveled 10,000 miles to the antipode, pondered different countries and career choices, yet we ended up renting a place barely 3 miles from our previous one.

The best way to describe how I felt during my first 2 weeks back in the Bay Area is whiplash. It's now been one year since we've been back, and when I look back, it has been a wild upwind course with four distinct legs.


#### Yet Another Job Hunt
After spending almost 3 months job hunting (virtually and in-situ) in Singapore, the prospect of re-starting from scratch back in the Bay Area was daunting. Fortunately I didn't have to worry about visa issues this time around, but the fact that it constantly came up reminded me of the realities of restrictions on immigration, even in so called 'high-skilled' jobs.

The only thing I was certain of is that after 8 years of working on different aspects of electric VTOL aircraft, I wanted to work in a different industry. Most of my network seemed to have moved on to autonomous vehicles, which although interesting, did not attract me enough as it felt too close to the eVTOL world (both on the technical front as well as the unrealistic timelines & hype.) After 2 months of dozens of emails, phone calls, and interviews, I ended up joining a finance company as a data scientist ...

#### My Corporate Hell
On paper, working in finance ticked a lot of boxes:
* Sufficiently different industry to provide exciting new challenges,
* Tons of learning opportunities about the inner workings of financial markets and products,
* Competitive compensation,
* Prospect of an international career (there are a lot more financial hubs than tech centers),
* and the cherry on top: the role was within a smallish innovation team working closely with an amazing group of Stanford professors (including my PhD advisor!)

Alas, what sounded like the ideal job soon collided with the realities of being a cog within a large corporation: insane bureaucracy, multiple layers of management (I was reporting to 4 people), and lack of an exciting mission. I also quickly realized that the role was not what had been advertised. Instead, I was going to be a glorified technical product manager (or at least what 3 out of 4 of the managers wanted it to be), having to navigate corporate politics to obtain access to data, all to ultimately implement a column on a trading dashboard. Of course it was going to be powered by 'AI' (aka linear regression), but did I really want to spend two years of my career building this?

By now I had spent 6 months thinking about my next career move, and after finally picking a job, I was **miserable** (I know that's a strong word, but I mean it) I had nights where I was so confused and sad that I cried: how did I end up in this situation? Why couldn't I be as happy or successful as all of my peers with their amazing looking titles and achievements on LinkedIn? Should I have stuck to one industry and just climbed the ladder? Maybe I should go back volunteering in Mozambique? Or if I just stick with this job for one or two years and hire 3 or 4 people to manage then I can spring to another job and I'll be happy then? Maybe at least wait another 6 months to get my end-of-year bonus (50% of my comp!)?

I had spent too much time during our travels knowing what it's like being happy to have the patience to be unhappy: I turned in my resignation after 8 weeks - what a contrast to my previous job tenure of 8 years!

[**#coronaperspective** It would have been interesting being part of that company during the crazy volatile markets - then again, I'm glad I don't have to get all my market transactions approved... ]

#### 7 Knots

Olivia made us go through an exercise back on the sailing boat where we scored what mattered to us in life:
{:refdef: }
<img style="width: 40%;" src="/assets/img/blog/2body/important-factors.jpg" >
{: refdef}


It doesn't come as a surprise that these were the three things I 'learned about myself' during my short tenure in "wall street":

1. I care a lot about the product I'm building: it needs to be exciting, technically difficult, and I want to do it alongside inspiring people that I can look up to.

2. The job I really wanted was the one that the professors had: the opportunity to contribute to a multitude of projects across a variety of industries (they all consulted with multiple companies).

3. My travel bug had not been satiated: I either needed a job that included a lot of travel or that would give me the flexibility to do so.



The job hunt was back on. But this time, instead of going through LinkedIn and applying to jobs, I reached out to my network and let people know that I was considering consulting work. Within 4 weeks, I had lined up 2 projects, and a couple of months later I had found a good rhythm working with 4 companies across different industries: small satellites, maritime shipping, delivery drones, and autonomous vehicles.

Things were going well: I was refreshing my technical skills and learning how all these companies were tackling different challenges, I was feeling the same excitement I felt in my early days at Zee, my clients were happy with my work, I didn't have to deal with commuting most days, and I was averaging 60 hour weeks and loving it (whenever I got bored or stuck on one project, I switched to another.)

It wasn't all rosy though: figuring out how to create an LLC, dealing with taxes, negotiating consulting rates, and juggling multiple laptops were all difficult but manageable. But (there is always a but?), there were really two things that kept nagging me:
* I didn't have a seat at the table, a say in the direction of any of these companies, or a sense of ownership: this was slightly frustrating at times especially given the time I had spent working on the product and business end of things back at KittyHawk.

* I was working so hard that I had no time for traveling and I was risking burning out.


#### Running Aground [**#coronaperspective**]

I made my peace with the first issues of not having a say. I figured that if I felt strongly enough about one of the companies, I'd just join full-time. Still, I needed a way to take advantage of my 'independence' as a contractor and avoid burning out.

I looked back on our year traveling, and I wanted to spend more time back out on the water. My collaborator on divethedata and I submitted a couple of grants to expand the project, and I found a sailing boat that was willing to take me on as a crew member to cross from New Zealand to French Polynesia and get involved in some coral gardening there.

This was a dream plan: I'd work 60-hour weeks for 6 months, then take 2-3 months to go sailing and diving. And to top it all, the plan was Olivia-approved!

I told my clients of my upcoming travels and started winding down projects with the goal of taking off mid-April. But just like sailboats run aground in the muddy waters at the channel edge, this all came to a sudden stop with Covid-19. At first, I was hoping it was a flood tide, i.e. that at worse this is a momentary delay while the water rises and things return to normal. But 2 months in, it's obvious that this is more of an ebb tide: travel restrictions will take a while to lift and the job market has changed significantly that it might not be as easy to find consulting work.

When we were aboard Galaxy, we often had to wait days for tides and winds to sync, and that never bothered me because, unlike Olivia, I wasn't worried about when we were disembarking and what we were doing next. The situation is now reversed, and I have a better understanding for how she felt and I hope I'll be able to internalize her wisdom on the matter:

> Galaxy couldn‚Äôt care less about what I want. Maybe it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs been focused on giving me what I need instead. Time to stop and digest momentous life changes undertaken all at once. A chance to face my fears and find my edges. A view of the horizon, and what might lay right behind it.
