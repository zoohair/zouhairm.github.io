title: Above Ground Altitude Estimation for Aircraft During Landing Phase
venue: Stanford University, 2015
authors: Z. Mahboubi
description: |
  I explored the use of an on-board camera to provide altitude estimation
  as a helping tool that could be used for training new pilots.
  I collected data from a cockpit view of an aircraft,
  and implemented a pipeline which detects runway edges and
  estimates the aircraft altitude.<br>
  Final results were promising but noisy (could benefit from Kalman filtering with some additional sensors)
