title: Data Analysis Tool for Flyable Days
venue: Kitty Hawk, 2016
authors: Z. Mahboubi
description: |
  Using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4">Beautiful Soup</a>, I scraped weather data relevant to aeronautical operations (winds, temperatures, clouds, rainfall, etc.) for different locations.<br>
  I computed cumulative histrograms, and linked the different criteria to each other. Then using an interactive display (built on <a href="https://bokeh.pydata.org">Bokeh</a>), I made it possible to adjust criteria to determine the number of flyable days for each location, and visualize the sensitivity to the different parameters.
