title: Camera Based Localization for <br>Autonomous UAV Formation Flight
venue: Stanford
contributors: in Collaboration with Z. Kolter, T. Wang, G. Bower.<br> Supervised by Prof. Andrew Ng.
description: |
  Using high power LEDs and computer vision, we determined the relative position between two UAVs in formation flight.
  The goal of the project was to demonstrate power savings when operating in the wake of an aircraft.
