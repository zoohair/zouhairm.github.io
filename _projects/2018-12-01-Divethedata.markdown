venue: Mozambique, 2018

  This was a project during my volunteering with the Marine Megafauna Foundation (MMF). In collaboration with Dan, we prototyped and built a website to help dive centers interested in contributing to citizen science highlight their data.
  <br><br>
  The data is visualized using <a href="https://plot.ly">Plotly</a> and <a href="https://plot.ly/products/dash/">Dash</a>. Three Plotly cross graphs, meaning what you select in one graph is reflected in the other two, make it possible to explore the data. This fledgling project is currently tracking 14 species of megafauna in the Inhambane province of Mozambique, and we are working on expanding it to other locations.
