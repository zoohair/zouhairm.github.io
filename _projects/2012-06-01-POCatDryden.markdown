description: |
  As an Aerospace Engineer, I participated in the flight testing of a proof of concept eVTOL aircraft. This included numerous flight-test campaigns at NASA facilities (Armstrong Flight Research Center (formerly Dryden) and Ames Research Center) in which I helped plan, execute, and monitor the performance of the aircraft and its subsystems.
