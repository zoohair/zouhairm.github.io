description: |
  As one of the early employees of <a href="https://cora.aero">Kitty Hawk</a> (formerly Zee.Aero), I participated in the design, construction, aerodynamic and stability analysis, control synthesis, and flight testing of the proof of concept for eVTOL aircraft. This included working on subscale models, both in free flight but also collecting windtunnel data.
