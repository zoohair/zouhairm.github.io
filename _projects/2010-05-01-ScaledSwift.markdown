description: |
  The Swift UAV is a foot-launched tailless sailplane that was converted to an electric UAV.
  This project was going to be my original PhD Thesis: building a sub-scale version of the aircraft in order to understand effects of scaling on the aerodynamic performance and dynamic response of sub-scale models.<br>
  I generated the aerodynamic stability derivatives used in the 6DOF simulation, and participated in the design of the avionics architecture for the Swift UAV.<br>
