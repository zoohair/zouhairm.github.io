description: |
  At Zee.Aero (now <a href="https://cora.aero">cora.aero</a>), I built a pilot simulator to experiment with control laws and inceptors, as well as for flight test pilots to train ahead of real life flights. 
  This involved connecting hardware-in-the-loop avionics with a 6DOF aerodynamics simulation, and displaying the aircraft's behavior on a curved screen. This required calibrating the projectors, minimizing and quantifying the lag between inceptors and display, building tools to emulate failures, etc.
